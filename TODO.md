## TODO


### functional programming
- Make some **testing videos** to see how it's performing
- Make a new subfolder containing **test scripts**: 
1. detection testing
2. audio testing
3. database testing
4. beta testing

### gamestate detection
- The different **starting points** and the choice can be expanded on
- train **regression algorithms** on data extracted from the detection functions

### music selection
- the **sensitivity** should be adapted by type of detection. If we detect a transition from a menu to another gamestate it should be instantaneous
- apply **valence** and **arousal** values to the selection process

## DONE

### functional programming

### gamestate detection

### music selection
- Use different starting points for music, or code some logic that selects a new starting point. (musicMain line 68)
- Use filter method to select by multiple possible moods
