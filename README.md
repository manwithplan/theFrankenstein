### The FrankenStein

Based on an old project, I have a dataset of 800+ pieces of classical music 
divided into snippets by **beat**.

I have analyzed the music for each snippet seperately and will make a program 
that can combine different pieces of music into each other in real-time.

A sort of classical music frankenStein, if you will.
